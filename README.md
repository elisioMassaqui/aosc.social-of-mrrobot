Project Description

The "Angola Open Source Community" is an official platform for collaborations on open-source projects. This website is designed for:

News and Updates: Keeping contributors informed about news and updates related to the world of open source.

```bash
Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

To start exploring the Open Source Contributions website project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository on your computer (Optional).
Download the project.
Navigate to the project's root directory.

Install the dependencies with npm install.
Start the development server with npm start.
Getting Started
Execute the following commands in Visual Studio Code or CMD.
```bash

```bash
npm run dev
# This command runs the "dev" script using npm. "npm" stands for Node Package Manager, and it's a widely used tool for managing packages and scripts in Node.js projects.

# or
# This is a comment to indicate that you can use the next alternative command if you prefer.

yarn dev
# This command runs the "dev" script using Yarn, another package management tool similar to npm, but known for being faster and more efficient in terms of performance.

# or
# This is another comment to indicate that you can use the next alternative command if you prefer.

pnpm dev
# This command runs the "dev" script using pnpm, yet another alternative to npm and Yarn, designed to be even more efficient in terms of disk space usage and speed compared to other package management tools.
In summary, the code provides three options to run the "dev" script in a Node.js project, allowing the developer to choose between npm, Yarn, or pnpm as the package management tool. This can be useful because different teams or projects may have different preferences when it comes to package management tools.


This command will install all the necessary dependencies for the project.

Running the Development Server
To start the development server and view the site, execute one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can edit the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
